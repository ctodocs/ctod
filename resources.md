# Documentation resources

Buiilding this workshop would have been nearly impossible without other people's documentation, and we'd like this site to continue to be a resource for others as well. 

Below is our "bibliography" and some links to other organzations' amazing docs sites. If you've taken this workshop and created some great docs, or if you've stumbled upon this and would simply like to be included in this list, please **[contrubute via GitHub](http://github.com/ctodocs/ctod)**.
