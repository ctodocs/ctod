# Writing Documentation
This workshop focuses on writing documentation for libraries and other cultural institutions.  
## What are you writing?
The documents you write today will contain markdown and be published to Github Pages.
## What is the purpose of your documentation?
The purpose of your documentation will influence the technical style you use.
### Provide instructions
Step-by-step instructions can include bulleted or numbered lists and are more likely to use short phrases or sentences than paragraphs. Introductory paragraphs can be helpful but instructional text should be short and clear.
### Map a workflow
Flowcharts and bulleted lists are useful when representing workflow.
### Describe department operations
This type of documentation can use a more traditional paragraph format. Lists of services can also be useful for some audiences.
## Who is the audience for your documentation?
The kind of content you include will depend on the audience. Determining your audience might also indicate whether your documentation will be offline, internal, or publicly available.
### Department staff
Documentation for staff within a department can include acronyms (Acronyms should always be spelled out before they are abbreviated.) and shared professional terminology. All the same, write documents that can be understood equally by new staff. Offline documentation can sometimes include privacy and security information like IP ranges or login instructions. Consider the culture of your department.
### Institution staff
The content of documentation for an institution will fall somewhere between department specific and public documentation depending on the institution.
### Public
Writing documentation for a public audience may require additional considerations like localization.
## Style
* [Microsoft Style Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/){:target="_blank"}
    * A good introduction to style for documentation
    * I recommend reading it through once then returning to sections as you think of questions related to your documentation.
* Organizing Information
    * Group related information.
    * Keep the number of grouped documents manageable.
    * Use 1 or 2 levels of facets.
    * Link related documents.
    * Balance linking to other documents with repeating information within documents.
* Clarity
    * Text should be skimmable.
        * Users should be able to follow your documentation without closely reading every word.
        * No negative or double negative gotchas.
    * Parallelism
        * Sentences should be formatted uniformly.
        * Words should appear in the same order in sentences within a section.
        * You may think repetition will lull users into skipping instructions but it’s easier for users that are reading along as they perform the instructions.
    * Short sentences
        * Keep sentences short and actionable.
        * It’s tempting to provide as much information as possible. Make sure sentences are short enough to be skimmed.
        * Use note boxes when more description or explanation is needed.
* Types of documents	
    * Instructions
        * Use bullet pointed lists.
        * Use 1 level of indentation in most instances.
        * Lists can be numbered but don’t use elaborate combinations of numbers and letters.
    * Map a workflow.
        * Use bullet pointed lists.
        * Create Flowcharts.
    * Describe your department.
        * Write short paragraphs.
* Audience	
    * Consider the detail of documentation.
    * Consider the use of sensitive information (passwords).
    * Consider the use of institutional and professional acronyms.
    * Consider how to display contact information.
 * TL;DR
    * First things first.
    * No negative or double negative gotchas.
    * Parallel Structures 
        * You may think repetition will lull users into skipping instructions but it’s easier for users that are reading along as they perform the instructions.
    * It’s tempting to provide as much information as possible. Make sure sentences are  short enough to be skimmed.
    * Lists can be numbered but don’t use fractions or combine letter and number hierarchies.
